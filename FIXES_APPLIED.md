# Fixes Applied to Medical RAG QA System

## Issue: Generic Template Answers with 0% Confidence

### Root Causes Identified
1. **ChromaDB using wrong distance metric** (L2 Euclidean instead of cosine similarity)
2. **Answer generator ignoring evidence** (hardcoded template response)

---

## Fix #1: Vector Store Distance Metric ✅

**File**: `backend/retrievers/vector_retriever.py`

**Problem**: ChromaDB was using L2 (Euclidean) distance by default, causing:
- Distance values of 16-39 (instead of 0-1 for cosine)
- Negative confidence scores after `1 - distance` transformation
- All documents filtered out by 0.5 similarity threshold

**Solution**:
```python
self.collection = self.chroma_client.get_or_create_collection(
    name=collection_name,
    metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"}  # ✅ Use cosine similarity
)
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Proper cosine distances: 0.07-0.17
- ✅ High confidence scores: 0.83-0.93
- ✅ Relevant documents retrieved successfully

---

## Fix #2: Evidence-Based Answer Generation ✅

**File**: `backend/generators/answer_generator.py`

**Problem**: The fallback generator was returning a hardcoded template:
```python
def _generate_fallback(self, prompt: str) -> str:
    return "Based on the available medical evidence, I can provide..."
    # ❌ Ignoring all evidence!
```

**Solution**: Extract and format actual evidence content:
```python
def _generate_fallback(self, prompt: str, evidence_texts: list = None) -> str:
    if evidence_texts and len(evidence_texts) > 0:
        answer_parts = []
        for evidence in evidence_texts[:3]:
            # Extract answer from Q&A format
            if 'Q:' in evidence and 'A:' in evidence:
                text = evidence.split('A:', 1)[1].strip()
            answer_parts.append(text)
        
        # Combine and deduplicate
        combined_answer = ' '.join(answer_parts)
        # ... deduplication logic ...
        return answer
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Answers contain real medical information
- ✅ Evidence properly extracted from Q&A pairs and abstracts
- ✅ Duplicate sentences removed
- ✅ Sources properly cited

## Current System Performance

### Test Results (After Fixes)

#### Question 1: "What are the side effects of Metformin?"
```
✓ Confidence: 35.7% (was 0%)
✓ Evidence Count: 5 documents
✓ Answer: "Efficacy and Safety of Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes. 
          Metformin is the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. 
          This meta-analysis of 100 studies shows that metformin 
          effectively reduces HbA1c levels by 1-2% and has 
          cardiovascular benefits. Common side effects include 
          gastrointestinal disturbances in 20-30% of patients..."
✓ Sources: 5 citations (MEDQUAD, PUBMED)
```

#### Question 2: "How does Metformin work?"
```
✓ Confidence: 33.2% (was 0%)
✓ Evidence Count: 5 documents
✓ Answer: "Metformin works primarily by decreasing glucose production 
          in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral 
          tissues. It also reduces glucose absorption in the intestines 
          and may have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism..."
✓ Sources: 5 citations
```

#### Question 3: "What is the best antibiotic for sinus infection?"
```
✓ Strategy: KG-only (no vector results yet, needs more data)
✓ Fallback: Provides helpful message to consult healthcare professional
```

## Files Modified

1. **backend/retrievers/vector_retriever.py**
   - Changed ChromaDB collection to use cosine similarity
   - Added debug logging for distance/confidence scores

2. **backend/generators/answer_generator.py**
   - Rewrote `_generate_fallback()` to extract evidence content
   - Updated `_generate_with_huggingface()` to pass evidence
   - Updated `_generate_with_openai()` to pass evidence  
   - Updated `generate()` to extract evidence texts
   - Improved source formatting with PMID and categories

3. **scripts/test_vector_store.py** (created)
   - Debug script to verify vector store functionality

4. **test_api.py** (created)
   - API testing script for direct backend verification

## Next Steps to Improve Further

### 1. Add More Medical Documents
```bash
# Expand the knowledge base
python scripts/download_data.py --source medquad --full
python scripts/download_data.py --source pubmed --query "diabetes treatment"
python scripts/build_vector_store.py
```

### 2. Expand Knowledge Graph
```bash
# Add real medical relationships
python scripts/build_knowledge_graph.py --source disease_ontology
```

### 3. Enable Full LLM Generation
```bash
# Option A: Install BioGPT dependencies
pip install sacremoses

# Option B: Use OpenAI API
# Add to .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 4. Lower Similarity Threshold (if needed)
Edit `backend/config.py`:
```python
similarity_threshold: float = Field(0.3, env="SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD")  # Lower from 0.5
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Ask medical questions**:
   - "What are the side effects of Metformin?"
   - "How does Metformin work?"
   - "What is Type 2 Diabetes?"
   - "What are the symptoms of sinusitis?"

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Confidence: 30-90% (not 0%)
   - ✅ Real medical content in answer
   - ✅ 3-5 source citations
   - ✅ Strategy: `vector_only` or `hybrid`

---

## System Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL

- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000 ✅ Running
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅ Running
- **Vector Store**: 8 documents ✅ Loaded with cosine similarity
- **Knowledge Graph**: 9 nodes, 7 edges ⚠️ Sample data only
- **Answer Generation**: ✅ Evidence-based (template fallback)
- **LLM Model**: ⚠️ Using fallback (BioGPT requires sacremoses)
