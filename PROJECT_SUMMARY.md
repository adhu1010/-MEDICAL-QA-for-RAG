**Option B: API (curl)**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/ask" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the side effects of Metformin?", "mode": "patient"}'
```

**Option C: API Docs**
- Visit http://localhost:8000/docs
- Try the interactive API

## 📊 Sample Interactions

### Example 1: Patient Mode

**Input:**
```json
{
  "question": "What are the side effects of Metformin?",
  "mode": "patient"
}
```

**Output:**
```
Common side effects of Metformin include nausea, stomach upset, 
and diarrhea. Rarely, it may cause lactic acidosis, a serious 
condition. Always consult your doctor if you experience severe 
side effects.

⚠️ Important: This information is for educational purposes only. 
Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before 
making any medical decisions.

Sources:
- kg: Metformin CAUSES Nausea
- vector: MedQuAD: Diabetes
- vector: PubMed: PMID12345678

Confidence: 85%
```

### Example 2: Doctor Mode

**Input:**
```json
{
  "question": "Explain the mechanism of action of Metformin",
  "mode": "doctor"
}
```

**Output:**
```
Metformin (C0025598) works primarily by decreasing hepatic glucose 
production through activation of AMPK and inhibition of gluconeogenesis. 
It also improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and reduces 
intestinal glucose absorption. Additional pleiotropic effects include 
anti-inflammatory properties and potential cardiovascular benefits
